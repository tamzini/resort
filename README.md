wix_resort_cloning

This is a cloning Website for a Resort template website belongs to Wix.com.
this project done few months ago while teaching myself  web development.

Techs used to build this repository :
    1- HTML.
    2- CSS.
    3- JavaScript.
    4- JQuery.

I added sticky menu feature using  JQuery which was not originally available.
I also made this website mobile first responsive using CSS  Media Query which means designing for mobile before designing for desktop or any other device (This will make the page display faster on smaller devices and mobiles). and as the last statistics show that more users view websites on thier mobiles its becoming so important to keep it mobile first. Thankfully CSS3 introduced Media Query which made that possible and easy to be done.

media="screen and (min-width: 480px)"

Instead of changing styles when the width gets smaller than 480px, we should change the design when the width gets larger than 480px. This will make our design Mobile First.
